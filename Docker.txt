sudo docker ps // will shw all running container
sudo docker images // will show all images downloaded
sudo docker pull ubuntu  // for downloading ubuntu image
sudo docker run -ti ubuntu bash  // within ubuntu bash command will run

Docker :
pywinrm 1.1
pywinarm 2.2


docker info // it will give you info about container , docker version
docker version  // it will give you information about client and server information

docker is written in Go language

docker container ls // to see active container  , container is image's running instance
docker image ls // to see the images available
docker network ls // to see available network

docker container run ubuntu cat /etc/os-release  // one container will be prepared by taking image of ubuntu then cat /etc/os-release will be executed after executing this command container will end i. e. in docker container ls command it will not be visible, after creating the container it will run as well that container

docker container ls // it will show all actively running containers, "docker ps"
docker container ls -a // it will show all container list even those which are termintaed

docker container rm "container id / name" // it will remove the container from list 
docker container start container id // to start a stopped container 
docker container stop container id // to stop a started container 

docker container run -d ubuntu sleep 30 // this will run the container in background ( detach mode)
docker container run -it ubuntu /bin/bash  // this will allow to go inside the container i. e. inside the ubuntu terminal with bash terminal , i for interactive and t for tty

once we come out of the ubuntu termianl then in that container will go to stopped state , if you want to come out of ubuntu terminal and continer should also be runnung then inside container execute "CTRL + P + Q"

docker container ls -aq // it will give the container id of all continers which are start/stopped state

if you want to kill all the containers ( start/stopped) then execute :
docker container rm $(docker container ls -aq)

docker container inspect container id // to get all the details of the container like IP address , hostname and all

docker container log container id // to see the logs of container
docker container top container id // to see what process are running inside container 
docker container stats // to see all running containers are consuming how much memory and cpu space

docker container run -d -p 3600:80 nginx --name test_nginx // test_nginx will be the name of this container or else it takes any key as container name 
3600:80  this is port mapping/forwarding i. e. all the requests coming from 3600 port of host machine those will be redirected to 80 port of container

if you want to access nginx from host machine (IP Of Host machine: 192.168.0.2) then in browser enter 192.168.0.2:3600
even in other machines browser you can access the nginx by same way (192.168.0.2:3600)


how to get the bash terminal of already running container : docker container exec -it  container id
docker container rename container id new_name // rename the container 
docker container restart container id // to restart a container 
docker container attach container id // to bring background container into foreground
docker container wait container id // this command will wait until this container does not stop , upon stopping this command will return 0
docker container pause container id  /// it will pasue the container we will not be able to access the services of that container at that time
docker container unpause container id  // it will unpause the container 
docker container prune // to kill all the container which are exited
docker container create ubuntu sleep 60 //  it will just create container not run it
docker container diff container id // it will show the difference between actual container image and files changed inside the container.
it will show files/directories which are newly added/ updated / deleted.

docker container cp test/ container_id:/tmp/ it will copy files from current server/machine's test directory to the container's /tmp directory 

docker container export container id > my_ubuntu_git_mysql.tar  // this will export the container with all its installed app(here git and mysql) into my_ubuntu_git_mysql.tar file , instead of > we can use -o also.

docker image import my_ubuntu_git_mysql.tar // for importing the image
